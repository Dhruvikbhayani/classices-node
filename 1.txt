a base on which different software applications can be developed. A node framework is a workspace platform that supports the use of Node.js and 
which allows developers to use JavaScript for developing front end as well as the back end of an application. Node frameworks are a wide 
collection of frameworks built on Node and that extend its properties and functionalities further.

4).What is difference between framework and library
The key difference between JavaScript libraries and frameworks is that libraries consist of functions that an application can call to perform a 
task, while a framework defines how a developer designs an application. In other words, the framework calls on the application code, rather than 
the other way around.
